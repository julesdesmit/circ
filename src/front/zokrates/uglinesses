overloading: 
    Functions are imported by name. If many functions have the same name
    but different signatures, all of them get imported, and which one to
    use in a particular call is inferred. (ZoK manual section 3.8)
    %%
        disallow explicitly?

inferred types for decimal literals (ZoK manual section 3.2)
    inside expressions
    in assignments if LHS
    add "untypedInteger" and unify as we go?

multi-assignment (unimplemented right now)

generics (maybe this is OK...)

add array-membership operator
add arithmetic-progression literal (to use with array-membership op)
should we make range checks explicit in IR?
    we have power-of-2 right now
    add non-power-of-2 range check?
